# web-calculator

## Part One
In the first part of the exercise, your calculator will be doing addition only. Your calculator should be made up of two fields for the user to provide you with numbers. It should have some indicator that lets the user know you will be adding them together. It should have a button for the user to request the answer. Finally, it should display that answer on the screen for the user. Your solution should consist of the HTML page that is presented to the user and the JavaScript code that will do the calculation.
